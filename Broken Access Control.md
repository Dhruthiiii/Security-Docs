Understanding Broken Access Control (BAC) for Beginners
What is Broken Access Control (BAC)?
Broken Access Control happens when a system doesn't properly enforce permissions or security rules, allowing users to access more data or perform actions they shouldn’t be allowed to. This is a major security vulnerability because it can expose sensitive information, allow unauthorized changes, and escalate user privileges, which can compromise the entire system.

In simpler terms:

BAC occurs when users can access data or perform actions beyond what they are allowed to.
It’s not about hacking, but rather about a system that fails to properly check who is allowed to do what.
Why is Broken Access Control Dangerous?
When BAC occurs, the consequences can be severe. Here are a few risks:

Data Breaches: Sensitive information might be exposed to unauthorized users.
System Manipulation: Attackers could modify or delete important data.
Privilege Escalation: Regular users might gain higher-level permissions, like admin access.
Regulatory Violations: It could lead to breaches of data protection laws.
Reputational Damage: The company could lose users' trust, impacting business.
Financial Losses: Not only from direct theft but also from the costs involved in fixing the breach.
Service Disruptions: Attackers could interfere with the normal operation of the system.
Key Point: BAC is about improper access permissions, not about actively hacking into the system.
How Does Broken Access Control Work?
BAC typically happens when:

The system doesn't properly check permissions.
User input is used in access control decisions without enough validation.
The system fails to verify access on the server-side after a user has logged in.
Metadata (like URLs or query parameters) is manipulated to bypass access controls.
A classic example of BAC is when someone can access another user's profile just by changing the ID in the URL, without being blocked by the system.

Common Types of Broken Access Control
Here are the most common Broken Access Control vulnerabilities that developers should watch out for:

1. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
What is IDOR? IDOR occurs when the system uses user input (like URLs or parameters) to reference internal objects (e.g., files, records) without checking if the user has permission to access them.

Example:
An e-commerce website might have URLs like:

bash
Copy
https://example.com/orders?id=1234
If the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized to view the order, an attacker can simply change the ID in the URL:

bash
Copy
https://example.com/orders?id=1235
This could give them access to another user's order, exposing sensitive details.

How to fix it:

Check that the logged-in user has the right to access the data.
Use session-based tokens instead of easily guessable IDs.
2. Vertical Privilege Escalation
What is Vertical Privilege Escalation? This happens when a low-privilege user (like a regular user) gains access to resources or actions that should only be available to higher-privilege users (like administrators).

Example:
Imagine a content management system (CMS) where a regular user should only be able to read articles, but they access an editor's function through a direct URL, like:

bash
Copy
https://cms.example.com/edit-article?id=5678
Now, this regular user has unauthorized editing rights for articles that should be restricted to admin users.

How to fix it:

Always check the user’s role before granting access to sensitive actions.
Use role-based access control (RBAC) to define what each user role is allowed to do.
3. Horizontal Privilege Escalation
What is Horizontal Privilege Escalation? This happens when a user can access data or actions meant for other users with the same privilege level.

Example:
On a platform where users can see their own profiles, a user might manipulate a parameter (like user_id) in the URL to view other users' profiles:

arduino
Copy
https://shop.example.com/profile?user_id=5678
Even though they aren’t an admin, they can view other users' personal information.

How to fix it:

Ensure users can only access their own data.
Use session-based authentication to verify the current user and check their permissions.
4. Missing Function Level Access Control
What is Missing Function Level Access Control? This happens when the application exposes sensitive functions (e.g., transferring funds, editing profiles) but doesn’t properly check whether the user has permission to access them.

Example:
In an online banking app, there might be a function that allows an admin to transfer money between accounts. However, if this function is not properly secured, a regular user could find and exploit it, transferring funds without permission.

How to fix it:

Always enforce authentication and authorization checks before executing any sensitive actions.
Ensure that role-based access control is applied across all functions, not just the UI.
How to Prevent Broken Access Control
Here are some best practices to prevent BAC vulnerabilities:

1. Enforce Strong Authentication and Authorization
Ensure that access to resources is properly controlled. Always verify the user’s identity and permissions.

2. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Define and enforce user roles and the permissions associated with those roles. For example:

Admin: Can access and modify all resources.
User: Can only access their own data.
3. Validate All User Inputs
Never trust user input. Always check whether a user is allowed to access the data or function they are trying to interact with.

4. Use Secure URLs and Tokens
Don’t expose sensitive information (like object IDs or user details) in URLs or parameters that can be easily manipulated. Use secure session tokens instead.

5. Conduct Regular Security Testing
Run tests (like penetration tests) and code reviews to identify and fix access control flaws in your application.

Final Thoughts
Broken Access Control is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in web applications, and it can have far-reaching impacts. It’s not about hackers using sophisticated tools to break into the system, but about ensuring that your system’s permissions are correctly implemented and enforced.

For developers, it’s essential to understand these risks and apply the proper checks in your code. By following the best practices mentioned above, you can significantly reduce the chances of your application being vulnerable to broken access control.

Remember: BAC is about making sure that everyone can only access what they’re allowed to. Always think about "Who should have access to what?" and enforce it at every level of your application.

This document should give newcomers a solid understanding of Broken Access Control and how it works, as well as practical steps to prevent it in their applications.
